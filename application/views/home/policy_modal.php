        <p>As an idea generator, with many concurrent projects in process, this privacy policy applies to all WinWinLabs sponsored projects. These will be identified as such, WinWinLabs, for example.</p>

<p>This privacy policy conveys the privacy practices for WinWinLabs and our websites. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by these websites, except where stated otherwise. It will notify you of the following:
    <ul>
    <li>What information we collect;</li>
    <li>With whom it is shared;</li>
    <li>How it is secured;</li>
    <li>How policy changes will be communicated; and</li>
    <li>How to address concerns over misuse of personal data.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>  
<p><b>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</b></p>

<p>We collect personal information, as well as statistics generated from the use of our services, and log information. WinWinLabs is the sole owner of information collected on our sites. We will never sell or disclose your information to anyone except as required by law. We may use the information to generate reports and statistics.</p>

<p>We will contact you only if required by law or if you choose to receive optional notifications. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to provide our services to our users, such as using Stripe and PayPal for payments.</p>

<p>Unless you ask us not to, we intend to contact you in the future to educate you about new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.</p>
 
<p><b>Registration</b></p> 
<p>In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration process. During registration a user is required to give certain information (such as name, age, and email address). This information is used to verify you are old enough to participate on our site, and also may be used to contact you about the products/services for which you have expressed interest. Due to the sensitive nature of working with minors, and compensating people in any way, we cannot accept any students under 16 years old until we develop a parent or guardian permission process.</p>
 
<p><b>Orders</b></p> 
<p>We record and archive all transactions that occur on our site, but we utilize 3rd party payment systems and do not store financial information on our servers or in our databases.</p>
 
<p><b>Security</b></p> 
<p>We donâ€™t want the most sensitive information stored on our websites, so let 3rd party companies who specialize handle that. The transactions that do occur, whether they contain sensitive data or not, are encrypted and transmitted in a secure way. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
 
<p><b>Cookies</b></p> 
<p>We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to login a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information on our site.</p>
 
<p><b>Links</b></p> 
<p>This web site contains links to other sites and projects. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
 
<p><b>Surveys & Games</b></p>
<p>We are about feedback and gamifying education. Participation in any surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate. Any user who earns an income over the US federal tax limit will receive a 1099. We may request more information so we can comply with federal tax laws. Your contact information will be used to notify of awards, prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of improving humanity.</p>
 
<p><b>Notification of Changes</b></p>
<p>Whenever material changes are made to the privacy policy we will send a notification email.
There are many enhancements that need to occur to this privacy policy to abide by all national and international laws. If you would like to assist us in becoming compliant in your part of the world it will enable us to accept users from there. Specifically, the EU has some major changes on May 25th we are not prepared for.</p>
 
<p>If you have any feedback relating to this privacy policy or feel we are misusing information please email us at support@winwinlabs,com</p>
